Requirements
------------

The scripts have been developed with Matlab , and CPLEX (freely downloadable with the `IBM Academic initiative <https://developer.ibm.com/academic/>`_), and successfully ran on several other versions of both softwares. However, it is important to respect the IBM compatibility specs sheets between Matlab, CPLEX, and the computer OS - available `on IBM's website <https://www.ibm.com/software/reports/compatibility/clarity/index.html>`_.

This module requires `matTFA <https://github.com/EPFL-LCSB/mattfa/>`_

Generating reduced models
-------------------------
1. Place the thermodynamic data for the corresponding orgnanism into the `matTFA thermoDatabases <https://github.com/EPFL-LCSB/matTFA/thermoDatabases>`_ folder.
2. Place the corresponding curated GEM into the GEMs folder.
3. Run the Run_REDHuman.m file
